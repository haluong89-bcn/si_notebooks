    "<a name=\"jupyter\"></a>\n",
    "Since the pathway pushes students both conceptually and technically,\n",
    "finding ways to take the deployment and management of the software stack\n",
    "out of the picture has been a priority. Our review of the pedagogical\n",
    "literature and practical experience gained in the private and HEI\n",
    "sectors—including several failures during the first few years of\n",
    "teaching—led us to the ultimate conclusion that a useful geospatial\n",
    "programming environment should possess the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Minimal Complexity**: it does not require students to load and\n",
    "    learn a new Operating System or large number of new\n",
    "    applications/platforms at the same time as they are learning to\n",
    "    code; it should also be reasonably ‘performant’ on a mix of student\n",
    "    and HEI hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Maximal Flexibility**: it is simple, if not always easy, to\n",
    "    configure and install on a range of hardware, but is not ‘sandboxed’\n",
    "    or ‘packaged’ in ways that constrain our freedom to install what we\n",
    "    need to teach effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Interactivity**: it allows us to keep commentary, ‘rich’ media,\n",
    "    and other scaffolding material together with the code so that\n",
    "    students can move between code and explanations easily, and can add\n",
    "    their own annotations as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Utility**: it supports life-long learning by providing a ‘real\n",
    "    world’ development environment that would be both familiar, and\n",
    "    accessible, to students after graduation in personal and\n",
    "    professional contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Maintainability**: it can be easily updated by the instructor(s)\n",
    "    and supports version control and easy distribution mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "These five features can, at times, appear to cut against each\n",
    "other—maximal flexibility and minimal complexity are difficult to\n",
    "reconcile since the former tends to expose more ‘options’ to the user,\n",

Table 1 summarises the pros and cons observed across the five dimensions identified by our review of the state-of-the-art nearly six years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Table 1. Evaluating Jupyter\n",
    "|  | Pros | Cons |\n",
    "|-----------|------|------|\n",
    "| **Minimal Complexity** | Deploying a full geographic data science 'stack' requires installing one application (Docker or Anaconda Python) and running two lines of code in a Terminal/Shell to install and configure Jupyter, its dependencies, and the analytical libraries. Environment requires no configuration. | Persistent challenges with student understanding of file system interaction and paths. Some confusion around multiple Python instances manifesting as different 'kernels' in notebooks. |\n",
    "| **Maximal Flexiblity** | Combination of Binder, Docker, and Anaconda Python allows us to install on nearly any hardware/operating system mix. Docker uses same YAML configuration script as Anaconda Python so maintaining compatibility and consistency straightforward. | Students cannot update Docker containers and do not gain understanding of package management or dependency conflict resolution. |\n",
    "| **Interactivity** | Students can view/edit/add rich media, code, and other content directly within the Jupyter notebook environment. Textual and graphical outputs from code cells in notebooks are saved between restarts of Jupyter. | Students do not develop a strong understanding of execution flow and system state. |\n",
    "| **Utility** | Growth of Jupyter has made it the 'tool of choice' for data scientists, and students are able to continue working with a fully functioning development environment. Students can edit installation and configuration scripts icnrementally, as expertise grows. | Relative ease of installation may not prepare students for managing their own development and production environments. Students remain unfamiliar with IDEs and code-completion in Jupyter is not as responsive (yet?). |\n",
    "| **Maintainability** | Docker and Anaconda update mechanisms are straightforward. GitHub works well for distribution, previewing, and (to a lesser extent) version control. | Nature of notebooks makes it harder for instructors to track incremental changes in version control, and for students to see value of such an approach. | \n",
    "\n",
    "From this, the principal technical recommendation is that a flexible mix of platforms should be used to deliver Jupyter-based learning. We recommend Binder to deliver foundational material using few non-core Python libraries, and now strongly recommend that students use Docker in subsequent modules. However, a critical issue is that Windows 10 Home Edition does not support Docker, and it is therefore *still* necessary to support direct installation of [Anaconda\n",
    "Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and associated configuration of the 'kernel' using a YAML text file. We are also investigating the use of a [containerised JupyterHub](https://github.com/conjuring) running on our own hardware: this would allow students to work _as if_ using Binder while benefiting from the ability to save work and make full use of Python's capabilities. All of the code supporting these configurations is available as a [Github repository](https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/gsa_env/)), as is Arribas-Bel's [resource](https://github.com/darribas/gds_env)."
